# Doctolib Appointment Checker

Used for the vaccination centers for Pfizer at the moment. Change sources to suit your needs.
It will open a browser and keep on refreshing.
It will notify you if there is an appointment available.
It will try to reserve the first slot for you but this is still WIP so be ready to book it yourself.
(Appointments are not so easy to find, hence harder to write and test).

# How to use

```
npm i
npm start
```
